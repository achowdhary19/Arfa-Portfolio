              </h1>
              <p> This sketch is a castle generator. As I was looking for inspiration online, I came across a twitter account that generates these playful looking castles every few hours.</p>

              <p>Amanda Cifaldi created the "Tiny Spires" twitter account. She was inspired by Mary Blair's small world art. </p>

                Design Process
              </h1>
              <p>  Because I needed to reference each shape's position throughout the code, I had to create some classes. Classes/object oriented programming is a powerful tool for managing objects and maintaining inheritance. I struggle using classes so this project was a good opportunity for me to practice. I created a few classes for a few differnet shapes and instantiated a few shapes for each column of the castle. In  the draw function, I drew shapes and moved their y position every 10 frames. I also had to redraw the function every 10 frames to make the shapes look like they're moving instead of just drawing multiple shapes a few pixels apart. I stopped moving a shape by checking if its y positon was at the bottom of the canvas or if it was at the top or the previous shape. Once a shape stopped moving, I drew another shape and repeated hteprocess until I finished the column. Finaly, I wanted to achieve a similar grainy texture as seen in the Tiny Spires' castles, so I added an off screen canvas that adds some noise on top of the main canvas. </p>

                Reflection
              </h1>
              <p>This project made me a lot more comfortable with object oriented programming. I did this in a very brute force way that could be condensed and more efficient, but its a good process to start by making something that works rather than star by trying to make the most efficient code possible. to get something working before </p>
