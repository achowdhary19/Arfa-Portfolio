            <h3>Brief</h3>
            <p>
              In summer 2025, I taught a two-week studio on AR game development
              for middle schoolers at NuVu Innovation School in Cambridge, MA.
              The goal was to introduce students to product development and
              programming in a way that feels accessible, intuitive, and
              empowering — especially for students with no previous coding or 3D
              experience. I adapted the curriculum, taught daily seminars, and
              guided students from initial concept to playable prototype through
              brainstorming, design, storytelling, world-building, and
              programming.

            <h3>About NuVu School</h3>
            <p>
              NuVu provides a non-traditional studio-based learning experience
              focused on design thinking, engineering, craft, and technology. In
              the classroom, students build real-world skills—like
              communication, collaboration, and adaptability—while exploring new
              technology and topics from different fields. NuVu's focus on
              design is grounded in problem solving, ensuring that students are
              active participants in the world and in the how and why of their
              work.

                  <h3>Teaching Approach</h3>
                  <p>
                    Designing and building a project can feel intimidating and
                    overly technical. I wanted to create a learning environment
                    where students could approach this process and new
                    technologies with curiosity rather than fear. The
                    alternative classroom environment removed barriers to
                    learning and allowed me to meet each student where they are.
                    I provided multiple ways for students to engage, access
                    information and demonstrate what they know.

                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                My goal was to introduce students to the design process from a
                high level perspective so that they can adapt this thinking in
                other settings. Within this process, they learned how to use
                technologies to communicate concepts in different forms. I
                adapted a syllabus based on the learning styles and interests of
                the students. I wanted the students to get a feel for every
                stage of the process - from drafting ideas on paper, to making
                quick prototypes, to developing a product. Using the syllabus as
                a guide rather than a rulebook, I confidently supported students
                through their individual learning experience, working with their
                unique set of strengths and weaknesses. I allowed the class to
                move flexibly through the process of making and understand it as
                a non-linear and always unfolding practice. This approach gives
                students a strong foundation into design thinking, making, and
                problem solving and equips them with the thinking muscles to
                take this into further applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the conceptual and technical skills learned in
                class, I aimed to embed socio-emotional learning competencies,
                like relationships skills and self management, throughout the
                studio. Practices like goal-setting, collaboration, reflection,
                and feedback helped the students build confidence, strengthen
                communication, and improve decision-making skills. Despite this
                being a software heavy class with most students working on
                projects alone, the class naturally turned to eachother to
                tackle problems and celebrate little wins together.

                  Each day, I taught lessons on a piece of the design process
                  followed by hands on activities to practice what we learned.
                  We started the class by discussing our interest in play and
                  analyzing games from different lenses - narrative, world
                  design, and gameplay. Next, the class collaboratively
                  brainstormed ideas for their games. Under a time constraint,
                  students came up with as many ideas as possible for game
                  environments, mechanics, and narratives. The students used the
                  collection of ideas to frankenstein together a game and
                  practiced fleshing out their idea further by sketching a
                  storyboard. After a few rounds of brainstorming and
                  storyboarding, students narrowed down their game ideas and we
                  moved into asset creation and digital prototyping, using
                  Delightex Edu (previously CoSpaces Edu), a block based 3D game
                  engine with AR and VR capabilities. Students continued
                  developing their games, debugging, playtesting, creating art,
                  until the final day where they presented their design and
                  development process to an audience and displayed their games
                  in an exposition.
