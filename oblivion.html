            <p>
              <strong>Oblivion</strong> is an atmospheric escape room game set
              during the Islamic Golden Age. Players embody a confused traveler
              who wakes up in a disheveled room with no memory of how they
              arrived. The traveler goes on a journey to find answers, exploring
              differnet locations, discovering broken artifacts and old texts.
              By restoring relics and solving puzzles based on these
              innovations, players unlock new areas and uncover their mysterious
              past.

                  • Collaborated in bi-weekly design discussions to develop
                  puzzle mechanics using historically accurate technologies from
                  the Islamic Golden Age, including instruments like the
                  Triquetrum, Astrolabe, Al-Jazari's Water Clock, and Abu

                  • Developed strategic input on level progression that balances
                  challenging puzzle design with engaging learning
                  opportunities, focusing on creating puzzles that:

                  • Documenting game issues with a team spreadsheet tracking
                  system where I categorize feedback (design suggestions,
                  technical bugs, art concerns) and prioritize issues based on
                  impact to gameplay.
                </p>

                <p>
                  • Uncovered critical user experience barriers in early builds
                  that caused confusiong and impeded game progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Proposed an innovative tutorial/guidance system using

                Development is ongoing, with ~35% of planned chapters now
                complete! My recommendations for a more intuitive guidance
                system was implemented in the most recent build, resulting in a
                significantly improved player experience. The development team
                incorporated optional hints, environmental feedback for player
                actions, and subtle audio cues that guide without interrupting
                gameplay.

                Playtester feedback has been positive—we've reported a much more
                enjoyable experience with the revised level design. The changes
                preserve the game's immersive quality while substantially
                improving the new player experience. playtesters completed the
                levels 50% faster with fewer requests for help, while still
                experiencing the intended sense of challenge, discovery, and
                achievement.
