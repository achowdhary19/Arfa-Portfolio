              <h1>
                Description
              </h1>
              <p>I was tasked with creating an abstract clock in p5. It was difficult to come up with a way to visually represent time that wasn't cyclical and didn't resemble a clock. I fear time and the passing of time and and try my best to maximize time by waking up early or not wasting my days. I wanted to sketch a clock that shows time escaping us or time being taken away from us. </p>
              <h1>
                Design Process
              </h1>
              <p>I started by making a simple clock with arcs representing seconds, minutes, and hours. </p>
                  <div class = 'fullwidth'>
                  <img class = "p5pic" src="/Portfolio/assets/clockWIP.png">
                  </div>

                  <p> Once I got this working, I played around with some shapes and lines that had parameters dependant on the current time. I had rectangles that resembled health bars depleting as time went on, but I was struggling to find a way to make that more interesting. I returned to the original clock made of arcs and tried to make it a cute, fish themed clock. I created a loop for the background to give it a glistening water effect and made some 8-bit fish sprites. </p>

                  <div class = 'fullwidth'>
                    <img class = "p5pic" src="/Portfolio/assets/clockWIP2.png">
                  </div>

                  <p> I was having a hard time getting the fish to rotate properly along the arc so that it looked like they were swimming, but I couldn't get it to work. This ended up looking like a regular clock with fish as the seconds/minutes hand. This wasn't really an abstract clock so I returned to my original idea of time being taken away and made a kind of count down clock seen in the sketch above. </p>

              <h1>
                Reflection
              </h1>

              <p> The clock turned out similar to how I wanted it to. I couldn't get the lines to disappear as the fish were passing through it, which interupts the flow of whole sketch.</p>
