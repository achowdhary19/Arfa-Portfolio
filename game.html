            <h1>Tiny Games</h1>

            <p>
                I am currently in a game design studio class where we make digital games for custom hardware within tight technical constraints. These are the first few games(unfininshed) I've made using puzzlescript, pico-8, and bitsy. 
            </p>

            <p>Updated Pico-8 game coming soon</p>
