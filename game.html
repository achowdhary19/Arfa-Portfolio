            <h1>Tiny Games</h1>

            <p>
                These games are tiny because they are sketchy and they are made within the tight technical constraints of their custom hardware. These games are made using puzzlescript, pico-8, and bitsy. <br>   
                <br>        
                My first puzzlescript game was inspired by 8-ball, a game I was really into at the time. Puzzle script's biggest constraint is their custom coding language. The main mechanic you can code is: if a player or object is next to something, something can happen. For example, one of the most famous tile based puzzle games Sokoban has one rule: If a player walks into a crate, then push that crate. This rule aligns with the mechanics of 8-ball and allowed me to create an interesting puzzlified version of 8-ball. <br>
                <br>



                Pico-8 is the most powerful game engine in the bunch. Because Pico-8 uses Lua, the games can be much more filled out and complicated as Lua supports object-oriented programming. <i>Art Angels</i> ( currently unfinished), is a butterfly catching game. <br>
                <br>

                Bitsy is another small editor that supports more narrative games. Bitsy games can have multiple rooms where sprites can talk to eachother and collect items. In my garden game, the player runs around collecting vegetables to bring back to the house and make soup with. <br>
