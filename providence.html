                I was part of a development team that built a web and mobile application that Providence could use to host their new AR volumetric videos. Providence worked with Intel to create these videos in order to provide patients a more engaging, interactive, comprehensive way to learn stetches, physical therapy excercises, or learn about ----.  After working with Intel to create these videos, Providence was looking for a way to host the videos on an easy to use application that users could learn from in their homes. I helped develop these applications using HTML, CSS, and javascript. I designed and developed the UI elements for the interface. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX5uOxRRFi4" target="_blank">video from Intel </a> from Providence about their volumetric videos Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAMJdSW4qDI&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Ftaylordupuy.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Ftaylordupuy.com&source_ve_path=OTY3MTQ&feature=emb_imp_woyt" target="_blank">video</a> that my coworker Taylor made with some more details about the applications.
