        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            I was part of a development team that built web and mobile applications to host Providence medical services' new AR volumetric videos. Providence used Intel's®️ RealSense™️ depth-sensing cameras to create a 3D virtual environment to help patients learn physical therapy exercises at home on their smartphones and create internal training videos to continue engaging Providence's current workforce. This unique technology solution set a new golden standard for at-home and after-care, which can be shared amongst patients along the healthcare system’s 51 hospitals. I designed and developed the UI elements for the interface. Using HTML, CSS, and javascript.
