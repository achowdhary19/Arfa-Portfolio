        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Over a 5-month period, I worked with a small team of three to develop
          a modular web and mobile application for Providence Medical Services.
          Our application was designed to display AR volumetric videos created
          using Intel® RealSense™ cameras, enabling patients to learn physical
          therapy exercises at home and providing internal training materials
          for Providence's workforce across their 51 hospitals.
        </p>

        <h3>Technical considerations</h3>
        <p>
          This project had many moving parts. Some key aspects and their
          challenges included:
        </p>

          <p style="margin-left: 0.5vw">
            <strong>⁑</strong> Designing an intuitive UI that maintained
            Providence's long standing brand identity <br />
            <strong>⁑</strong> Building a user-friendly interface that expands
            access to specialized care, particularly for patients in remote
            locations who can't easily visit physical therapy facilities in
            person.<br />
            <strong>⁑</strong> Creating an accessible interface that worked
            across both desktop and mobile devices<br />
            <strong>⁑ </strong> Integrating volumetric videos into an augmented
            reality environment, allowing patients to view exercises from
            multiple angles and better understand proper form and technique.
            These videos needed to be properly placed in the user's physical
            space, maintain proper scale and perspective, and remain responsive
            to user interactions<br />
            <strong>⁑</strong> Developing a hosting solution that was more
            cost-effective than their existing third-party platform <br />
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>My Role & Contributions</h3>
        <p>
          As a software developer on the project, my primary responsibility was
          designing and implementing the user interface. I used Figma to design
          a reusable UI component library that could adapt to differnet AR
          experiences. With that, I built a visual system that maintained
          Providence's established brand integrity and focused on accessibility
          for differnet users/use cases.<br /><br />
          While I focused on UI design, our team collaborated closely on all
          aspects of development. I worked with my teammates to implement the
          augmented reality technology and ensurethat the interface we built +
          the volumetric videos fit properly with the AR environment. Using
          A-frame and 8th wall, we displayed the motion captured virtual
          environments in the user's real world. To add functionality to the
          app, we integrated the interactive button elements with the video
          player to ensure the appropriate response was triggered(i.e.
          pause/play, mute, captions, video scrubbing, looping).
        </p>

        <h3>Impact & Results</h3>
        <p>
          At the end of the project, Providence had functional, reusable
          prototypes that no longer rely on third party hosting, allowing them
          to pursue grants for additional features and expand the market for
          their volumetric videos. <br />
          The project was featured in Intel promotional materials and showcased
          at Providence's "SEAL: Stop Everything and Learn" week. <br />
