            <p>
              Focus Group Contributor & Playtester: "Oblivion" (Unity Production
              Foundations) As a core playtester for this 3D mobile puzzle game
              set in historical environments, I provide critical UX feedback and
              player perspective insights through bi-weekly development
              discussions. My contributions help shape puzzle mechanics and
              player experience in this historically-inspired game currently in
              early development. Focus Group Contributor & Playtester:
              "Oblivion" (Unity Production Foundations) | 2024-Present As a core
              member of the pre-development design focus group, I've influenced
              this 3D mobile puzzle game from concept stages through early
              development. My contributions include shaping core puzzle
              mechanics, providing level design input during planning sessions,
              and delivering detailed gameplay feedback as a regular playtester.
              The historical setting presents unique design challenges that our
              bi-weekly discussions help resolve, balancing period authenticity
              with engaging gameplay. My perspective helps bridge the gap
              between developer intentions and player experience.

              <strong>⁑</strong> Designing an intuitive, accessible desktop and
              mobile UI that maintained Providence's long standing brand
              identity.
              <br />
              <strong>⁑</strong> Building a user-friendly experience that
              expands access to specialized care, particularly for patients in
              remote locations who can't easily visit physical therapy
              facilities in person.<br />
              <strong>⁑ </strong> Integrating volumetric videos into an AR
              environment, allowing patients to view exercises from multiple
              angles and better understand proper form and technique. These
              videos needed to be properly placed in the user's physical space,
              maintain proper scale and perspective, and remain responsive to
              user interactions. <br />
              <strong>⁑</strong> Developing a hosting solution that was more
              cost-effective than their existing third-party platform. <br />

            <h3>My Role & Contributions</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1vh">
              As the UX/UI designer on the project, I took ownership of the
              entire design process while collaboratively implementing
              interactive elements through pair programming.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1vh">
              I independently created all UI wireframes and high-fidelity
              prototypes in Figma, designing a comprehensive component library
              of 15+ UI elements that maintained Providence's established brand
              guidelines and were reusable for other AR applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through pair programming sessions with my development team, I
              directly contributed to implementing the AR environment and
              interactive elements using JavaScript and A-frame. My specific
              coding contributions included building the custom video player
              controls (play/pause, mute, video scrubbing) and developing the
              responsive behavior that ensured proper video scaling across
              devices.

            <h3>Impact & Results</h3>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1vh">
              The application we delivered provided tangible benefits for
              Providence Health. Our team's solution replaced their previous
              third-party platform with an AWS-based infrastructure, reducing
              their annual hosting costs by thousands of dollars.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1vh">
              The successful prototypes served as proof of concept, leading
              Providence to pursue additional grant funding for feature
              expansion and expand the market for their volumetric videos.
              Initial feedback from Providence staff indicated improved training
              efficiency and higher patient engagement with physical therapy
              routines.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1vh">
              The project gained industry recognition, being featured in
              multiple Intel promotional materials and showcased at Providence's
              "SEAL: Stop Everything and Learn" week.

  SEAL – Stop everything and learn is an entire month with its grand finale tomorrow. The theme this year is Innovation with Compassion and we did around 10 different learning events including Mindful techie where we shared our chair yoga personal coach.
