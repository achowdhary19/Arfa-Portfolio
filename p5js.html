              <h1>
                Description
              </h1>
              <p>I was tasked with creating an abstract clock in p5. It was difficult to come up with a way to visually represent time that wasn't cyclical and didn't resemble a clock. I fear time and the passing of time and and try my best to maximize time by waking up early or not wasting my days. I wanted to sketch a clock that shows time escaping us or time being taken away from us. </p>
              <h1>
                Design Process
              </h1>
              <p>I started by making a simple clock with arcs representing seconds, minutes, and hours. </p>
                  <div class = 'fullwidth'>
                  <img class = "p5pic" src="/Portfolio/assets/clockWIP.png">
                  </div>

                  <p> Once I got this working, I played around with some shapes and lines that had parameters dependant on the current time. I had rectangles that looked like health bars depleting as time went on, but I was struggling to find a way to make that more interesting. I returned to the original clock made of arcs and tried to make it a cute, fish themed clock. I created a loop for the background to give it a glistening water effect and made some 8-bit fish. </p>

                  <div class = 'fullwidth'>
                    <img class = "p5pic" src="/Portfolio/assets/clockWIP2.png">
                  </div>

                  <p> I was having a hard time getting the fish to rotate properly along the arc so that it looked like they were swimming, but I couldn't get it to work. This ended up looking like a regular clock but with fish as the seconds/minutes hand. This wasn't really an abstract clock so I returned to my original idea of time being taken away or making a kind of count down clock seen in the sketch above.  </p>

              <h1>
                Reflection
              </h1>

              <p> The clock turned out siimilar to how I wanted it to. I couldn't get the lines to disappear as the fish were eating it, which interupts the flow of whole sketch and Im considering changing the scale of some of the fish that represent months or years as time goes on.</p>
