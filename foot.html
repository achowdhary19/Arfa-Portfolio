            <h1>Inspired by History: Person Throwing a Stone at a Bird</h1>
            <p> This image is an emulation of Joan Mir√≥'s painting, Person Throwing a Stone at a Bird. I recreated his painting because I appreciate his childlike and spontaneous style. Creating this reminded me how much I enjoy making surreal images and digital things that feel tangible.</p>
