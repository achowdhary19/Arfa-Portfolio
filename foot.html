            <h1>Inspired by History: Person Throwing a Stone at a Bird</h1>
            <p> This image is an emulation of Joan Mir√≥'s painting, Person Throwing a Stone at a Bird. I chose to recreate his painting because I appreicate his childlike and spontaneous style. Recreating this made me realize how much I enjoy making surreal images and digital things that feel tangible.</p>
